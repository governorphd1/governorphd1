- 👋 Hi, I’m @governorphd1 or Howard
- 👀 I’m interested in gaining confidence in Programming.  Java and Python in particular.  Main goal is to build a web app.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, using Flask to get aquainted with the proceedures of web app development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who is also on this level, and anyone who has the time to share some thoughts or ideas.
